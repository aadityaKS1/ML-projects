# Titanic Survival Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This project analyzes the **Titanic dataset** to understand patterns that affect passenger survival.  
The analysis focuses on exploring the data, cleaning it, and checking correlations with the target variable `Survived`.

## Libraries Used
- `pandas` – Data manipulation  
- `numpy` – Numerical operations  
- `matplotlib` – Data visualization  
- `seaborn` – Advanced plots  

---

## Steps in the Project
1. Load the dataset (`train_data.csv`)  
2. Explore the dataset  
   - Check shape, head, sample rows  
   - Data types and missing values  
   - Duplicate rows  
3. Statistical summary of numerical features  
4. Correlation analysis to see which features affect `Survived`
